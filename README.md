## summary

- this project is the REST API that facilitates the communication between front and backend, that allows clients to interact with the website application through http requests

## Overview

- In the REST API section of the Airbnb clone project, the API acts as an intermediary layer between the frontend and backend components of the application. By exposing endpoints that correspond to various actions and resources within the system, such as fetching listings, making bookings, and managing user profiles, the API enables seamless communication and data exchange between the client-side JavaScript code and the server-side database. Leveraging technologies such as Node.js, JavaScript, and SQL via TablePlus, the REST API provides a standardized interface for accessing and manipulating data, promoting modularity, scalability, and maintainability in the application architecture.
